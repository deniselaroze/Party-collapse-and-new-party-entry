Elections took place separately in the Aosta-Valley, overseas and in Italy itself. The data presented includes the results of all votes taken together. With the new electoral law incentives were given for the parties to organize themselves in two big coalitions (the coalition with the most votes gets at least 340 of the 630 seats in the lower chamber) and to form smaller electoral alliances as a response to a series of thresholds to get seats in parliament.
The vote in the italian homeland (excluding Aosta-Valley and voting outside italy) was won by The Union (19.002.598 votes) against House of Freedoms (18.977.843) resulting in 340 to 277 seats in the lower chamber for the italian homeland.
In the table below, the results of parties which didn't win any seat in parliament or had less than 0.5% support of voters are only provided if they supported one of the two main coalitions.
